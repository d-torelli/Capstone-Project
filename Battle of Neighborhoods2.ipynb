In case of success, the franchise will explore different location across Canada and the US. <br> For this reason, a location in Downtown Toronto needs to be selected for the first opening. BellaVita Ltd has requested our aid in finding the optimal location according to the concept of the venue, in order to maximise the chances of success.<br>\n",

    "The restaurant concept is of a modern and sleek appearance that would cater to business workers during the week. It will offer breakfasts, lunches, afternoon coffees, after-work drinks and dinners. The offer will be a modern italian cuisine born from the experience of business-minded Milan, Italy. <br>\n",
    "With these requirements, the location choice falls into the Downtown Macroarea. Within this framework, our task would be to identify which specific sector would offer the most fruitful chances for prosperity, given the concept of the restaurant, and the preferred target. <br>\n",
    "Taking this into consideration, we will analyze downtown Toronto and its amenities, locations and venues, to find clusters and commonalities, which will point us to the area where it will make more sense to open BellaVita's venue."
